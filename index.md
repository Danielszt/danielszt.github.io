<br>
Iâ€™m Daniel SÃ¡ez, a versatile designer with a knack for strategy and craft. 
Currently, I work at [Hanzo](https://hanzo.es/). Before I was at [Lingokids](https://lingokids.com/), [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en), [Fever](https://feverup.com/) and [Buzzial](https://buzzial.com/).

<br>
Some of my work:

- [Customer portal redesign](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/customer-portal/)
- [Medical estimate feature](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/medical-estimates/)
- [Payment solutions website](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/getnet-europe/)

<br>
Some things I believe in:

- A well-defined problem leads to better solutions.
- Clear writing reflects clear thinking.
- Good design solves problems and feels great.
- Data-informed > data-driven.
- Talking to users > abstract research models.
