<br>
Iâ€™m Daniel SÃ¡ez, a versatile designer with a knack for strategy, craft and storytelling. 

Currently, I work at [Hanzo](https://hanzo.es/). Before I was at [Lingokids](https://lingokids.com/), [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en), [Fever](https://feverup.com/) and [Buzzial](https://buzzial.com/).

<br>
Some of my work:

- [Restaurant reservation flow for MeliÃ¡ Hotels](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/reservation-process/)
- [Customer portal redesign for Holcim](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/customer-portal/)
- [Medical estimate feature for Vithas](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/medical-estimates/)

<br>
Some things I believe in:

- A well-defined problem leads to better solutions.
- Regularly talking to users sharpens product instinct.
- Data-informed beats data-driven.
- Good design solves problems and feels great.
- Clear writing reflects clear thinking.
