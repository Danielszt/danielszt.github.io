<br>
I'm **Daniel SÃ¡ez**, a **designer** who believes that:
- Defining the problem well is key to finding solutions
- Obvious UX > fancy UX
- Clear writing reflects clear thinking
- Communicating design decisions is often as important as the design itself

<br>
Currently, I work at [Hanzo](https://hanzo.es/). Before I was at [Lingokids](https://lingokids.com/), [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en), [Fever](https://feverup.com/) and [Buzzial](https://buzzial.com/).

<br>
Below you can see a summary of some of my works:

- [Customer portal redesign](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/customer-portal/)
- [Medical estimate feature](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/medical-estimates/)
- [Payment solutions website](https://danielszt.github.io/projects/getnet-europe/)
