My name is **Daniel SÃ¡ez**. I'm a **UX Writer / Content Designer** with +5 years of professional writing experience. I like turning complicated ideas into simple concepts and being useful to others through my work.

<br>
Currently I work at [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en), where I'm part of the core team in multiple projects. Before I was at [Fever](https://feverup.com/), at [Buzzial](https://buzzial.com/) and working as a freelancer.
