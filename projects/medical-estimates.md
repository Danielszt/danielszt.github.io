## 🧭 Context
---
### About Vithas
Vithas is a hospital group with 20 hospitals and 16 medical centers in Spain. Through its **Patient area** (accesible via app and web), patients can make appointments, manage their medical information, contact Vithas and much more.

### Task and goal
We wanted to offer users the possibility of consulting, managing and paying for **Medical estimates** directly on the patient area. So the task consisted of designing the MVP of this new feature.

Expressed as user story:

- As a patient, I want to have online access to my medical estimates so I can review and pay them without having to go to the hospital.

<br>
## ☝🏻 My role 
---
I was responsible for UX in a multidisciplinary squad composed of a front-end, a back-end, a product manager and myself.

<br>
## 🔎 Research
---
### Interview with stakeholders
I had an interview with 2 stakeholder who work daily with estimates and patients. Thanks to this I was able to better understand the characteristics of medical estimates and capture some key requirements for the design.

### Patient journey workshop

I organized a workshop to uncover the current user journey and understand customer needs. I invited the 2 stakeholders I previously had the interview with and the rest of the team. The resulting user journey provided us with a holistic view of the actual patient experience with medical estimates.

## ✏️ Definition

### User flow
I translated the design ideas and requirements into a user flow. As soon as it was ready, I immediately shared it with my technology colleagues and stakeholders. In my experience, sharing the work early on speeds up validation and helps everyone feel part of the task.

## ⚡ Design
---
First I draw some low-fi wireframes on paper to organize my ideas (too bad I don't keep them, paper wireframes look so cool on portfolios 😅). After that, I switched to hi-fi using the **Vithas Design System**. Below you can see the designs for the app and the desktop version:
