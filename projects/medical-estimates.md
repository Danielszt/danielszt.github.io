title: Medical Estimate Feature

*Project carried out in [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en) for [Vithas](https://vithas.es/home)*<br>

## 🧭 Context
---
### About Vithas
Vithas is a hospital group with 20 hospitals and 16 medical centers in Spain. Through its Patient area (accesible via app and web), patients can make appointments, manage their medical information, contact Vithas and much more.

### Task and goal
The task consisted of designing an MVP of a new functionality. We wanted to offer the possibility of consulting, managing and paying for medical estimates directly on the patient area.

Expressed as user story:

- As a **patient**, I want to **have online access to my medical estimates** so I can **review and pay them without having to go to the hospital**.

<br>
## ☝🏻 My role 
---
I was responsible for UX in a multidisciplinary squad composed of a front-end, a back-end, a product manager and myself.

<br>
## 🔎 Research
---
### Interview with stakeholders
I had an interview with 2 stakeholder who work daily with estimates and patients. Thanks to this I was able to better understand the characteristics of medical estimates and capture some key requirements for the design.

### Patient journey workshop

I organized a workshop to uncover the current user journey and understand customer needs. I invited the 2 stakeholders I previously had the interview with and the rest of the team. The resulting user journey provided us with a holistic view of the actual patient experience with medical estimates.

### User flow
I translated the design ideas and requirements into a user flow. As soon as it was ready, I immediately shared it with my technology colleagues and stakeholders. In my experience, sharing the work early on speeds up validation and helps everyone feel part of the task.

## ⚡ Design
First I draw some low-fi wireframes on paper to organize my ideas (too bad I don't keep them, paper wireframes look so cool on portfolios 😅). Then I switched to hi-fi using the Vithas Design System, and after a couple of iterations, this was the design of the MVP:
