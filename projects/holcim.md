<br>

## The problem

Customers were struggling to order materials and track orders in Holcim’s customer portal due to unnecessary complexity and confusing UI. This was leading to errors, additional manual work, and reluctance to transition from email and phone to the portal for managing orders.

## Uncovering customers pain points and business goals

First, I needed to understand the project’s business goals and identify the customer's pain points. To achieve this, I conducted interviews with stakeholders and attempted to interview customers, though this wasn’t possible. Instead, I interviewed the customer support team, using them as a proxy to gain deeper insights into user needs.

<br>
This is what i learnt:
<br>

**Business goal**

- Increase portal adoption by customers, who refuse to use it due to the user pains above and place orders by phone instead.

**Main user pains:**

- The current ordering process was complex, time-consuming and prone to errors
- Matching orders, deliveries, and invoices was complicated by the lack of links between them.
- Customers had difficulty finding specific orders because the filters don’t match their needs.
- Reordering previous purchases was challenging, and the feature likely went unnoticed by many customers.
- Bulk ordering is inefficient and error-prone.
- Customers aren’t being notified about changes in their order status.

## Understanding the system

I had a lot of complexity before me, so I used OOUX (Object-oriented UX)  to break it down. This allowed me to map out the system’s architecture, collaborating closely with Holcim’s team to understand how it supported (or hindered) user tasks and ensure we had a complete grasp of all the elements.

## Analyzing the current UI

I also analyzed the current UI to determine what works well and what’s need to me improved and uncover gaps or areas where new functionality could provide added value.

## User flows

I decided to create user flows and review them with Holcim’s team to ensure we weren’t having gaps and to align on system requirements. This collaboration helped identify potential friction points early and ensured the flows would be feasible from a technical perspective, leading to a smoother implementation process.

## Low-fi exploration

I always like to explore many different ideas before committing to one, usually on paper. It helps me to discard the ideas that don't feel quite right and to have an overview of all the different paths I could take.
