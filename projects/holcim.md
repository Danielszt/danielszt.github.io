## The problem

Customers were struggling to order materials and track orders in Holcim’s customer portal due to unnecessary complexity and confusing UI. This was leading to errors, additional manual work, and reluctance to transition from email and phone to the portal for managing orders.

## Uncovering customers pain points and business goals

First, I needed to understand the project’s business goals and identify the customer's pain points customers. To achieve this, I conducted interviews with stakeholders and attempted to interview customers, though this wasn’t possible. Instead, I interviewed the customer support team, using them as a proxy to gain deeper insights into user needs.

<br>

This is what i learnt:

**Business goal**

- Increase portal adoption by customers, who refuse to use it due to the user pains above and place orders by phone instead.

**Main user pains:**

- The current ordering process was complex, time-consuming and prone to errors
- Matching orders, deliveries, and invoices was complicated by the lack of links between them.
- Customers had difficulty finding specific orders because the filters don’t match their needs.
- Reordering previous purchases was challenging, and the feature likely went unnoticed by many customers.
- Bulk ordering is inefficient and error-prone.
- Customers aren’t being notified about changes in their order status.

## Understanding the system

I had a lot of complexity before me, so I used OOUX (Object-oriented UX)  to break it down. This allowed me to map out the system’s architecture, collaborating closely with Holcim’s team to understand how it supported (or hindered) user tasks and ensure we had a complete grasp of all the elements.

## Analyzing the current UI

I also analyzed the current UI to determine what works well and what’s need to me improved and uncover gaps or areas where new functionality could provide added value.

## Information architecture

To set the basis for the redesign and  agree on scope I defined the Information architecture. 

I followed this process: 
1. Mapped the previous architecture
2. Explored all sections
3. Got familiar with the details
4. Merged conceptually similar features
5. Presented it to stakeholders to get their input and iterate 

We should have tested it with users, but we didn’t. I would have done an open card sorting to uncover user mental models and a tree testing to validate the proposal.

## Aligment workshops

At the beginning of each sprint, I would have a workshop with the stakeholder responsible for the feature we were about to start working on.

At this meeting we discussed:
- Requirements and assumptions
- Backend structure and constraints
- Problems users were facing
- Other ideas we might have had

The output of the meeting was a shared PRD (Product Requirements Document) This approach ensured that our design decisions were well informed and aligned with the project goals.
