title: Medical Budget Feature

*Project carried out in [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/en) for [Vithas](https://vithas.es/home)*<br>

## üß≠ Context
---
### About Vithas
Vithas is a hospital group with 20 hospitals and 16 medical centers in Spain. Through its Patient area (accesible via app and web), patients can make appointments, manage their medical information, contact Vithas and much more.

### Task and goal
The task consisted of designing an MVP of a new functionality: budgeting. We wanted to offer the possibility of consulting and paying for medical budget directly on the patient area.

Expressed as user story:

- As a **patient**, I want to **have online access to my medical budgets** so I can **review and pay them without having to go to the hospital**.

<br>
## ‚òùüèª My role 
---
I was responsible for UX in a multidisciplinary squad composed of a front-end, a back-end, a product manager and myself.

<br>
## üîé Research
---
### Interview with stakeholders
I had an interview with 2 stakeholder who work daily with budgets and patients. Thanks to this I was able to better understand the characteristics of a budget and capture some key requirements for the design.

### Patient journey workshop

I organized a workshop to uncover the current user journey and understand customer needs. I invited the 2 stakeholders I previously had the interview with and the rest of the team. The resulting user journey provided us with a holistic view of the actual patient experience with budgets.

## ‚ö° Definition

### Architecture
Now that I had managed to understand Getnet's complex ecosystem, It was time to define the information architecture of the web. This was the result:

<br>
### Navigation
Once the  the information architecture was validated with stakeholders, I designed a navigation model that would allow users to:

- Navigate comfortably through the different sections.
- Explore Getnet's products from different perspectives (by feature, by industry...)

### Pages and modules
We adopted a content-first + modular design approach to design all pages. This meant that the content determined the structure of each page and we designed content blocks that can be used on any page.
