# Context
---
### About Meli√°

Meli√° is the third largest hotel chain in Europe, with 350+ hotels in 35 countries. I worked with them on several projects over the course of about a year. 
<br>
<br>

### The problem

Meli√° restaurants managed table reservations through a variety of methods, mostly phone calls and third parties. The lack of an unified reservation system caused inconsistent customer experience and operational inefficiencies.
<br>
<br>

### Role and team

The team consisted of a UX designer (myself), a visual designer, a front-end developer and a product manager. We worked closely with Melia's product manager and engineers.
<br>
<br>

### Design process 

1. **Discovery**:	understand the problem, user needs and business goals
2. **Definition**: agree on what criteria the solution should meet
3. **Prototype**:	explore and communicate design ideas
4. **Test**: identify gaps in the solution and reduce risk
5. **Final design**:	develop a polished design ready for implementation

<br>

# Discovery
---
### Stakeholder interviews

I created a research project in our research database, wrote down our learning objectives and prepared the interview strip. Then I met with Melia's product manager and the engineers responsible for the reservation system.

This helped me to gather initial requirements and understand business goals.

<br>

#### Business goals <br>
- Increase efficiency:	streamline the reservation process to reduce staff worload and improve inventary management
- Reduce dependency on third parties:	minimise reliance on third-party reservation systems and reduce associated costs
- Improve brand experience:	ensure consistent quality and brand experience across all touchpoints, reinforcing brand reliability

<br>

### Backoffice analysis
<br>

<br>

I explored the backoffice and discussed my questions with the Meli√° team. This helped me to ensure data consistency and identify technical constraints.
<br>

**Technical constraints**:

- **Can‚Äôt modify reservations**: the system couldn't handle reservation changes, just delete them and create new ones.
- **Can‚Äôt show availability at calendar level**: the booking engine couldn‚Äôt show availability at calendar level due to performance reasons.
- **Time slots must be service-based**: time slots had to be split by service (breakfast, lunch...) and be presented at 15 minute intervals.
-  **Not all reservations are auto-confirmed**: restaurants could disable automatic confirmation for large groups or people.

<br>

## Definition
---
### Requirements document

With all the info I had from the discovery, I wroted a productd requirements document (PRD) stating:

- Problem to solve
- Goals
- KPIs
- Limit and constrains
- Requirements

I reviewed it with Melia‚Äôs team to make sure we were on the same page.

<br>

### User flow

Using the PRD as a foundation, I created a user flow and reviewed it with the team and stakeholders.

This allowed us to map all use cases, connect the user flow with the backend and account for users emails and communications

## Prototype

### Low-fi exploration

I started exploring with very low fidelity.

This always help me visualise many ideas quickly and weigh the pros and cons.

<br>

### Wireframe prototype

After some iterations and good feedback, I ended up with a solid proposal. I prototyped each use case so everyone could ‚Äúfeel‚Äù and test the experience.

## Test
---
### Guerrilla testing

User testing wasn't in the budget or project plan, so instead I did some guerrilla testing.

No problems were reported, which gave me mixed feelings.
