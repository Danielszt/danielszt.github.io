<br>
## The project
------
The challenge was to redesign the client area of a big infrastructure and renewable energy company present in more than 50 countries.

To this end, and after some research, we defined three principles that guided us throughout the entire project: improve **usability**, adopt **clear communication** and increase user knowledge about their **water consumption** at home.


<br>
<br>
## My role
------
- I defined the **content structure** and wrote the **copies** for all the screens and processes.
- I participated in the definition and iteration of the **information architecture**.
- I created a **style guide** with tone of voice, grammar and formatting best practices, and a controlled vocabulary.
