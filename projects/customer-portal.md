# Context

## About Holcim

Holcim is a leading supplier of cement, aggregates and other materials. With a presence in 70 countries and more than 63,000 employees worldwide, Holcim is committed to driving progress for people and the planet through innovative and sustainable building solutions.

## Problem to solve

Originally developed as an internal tool, Holcimâ€™s Customer Portal needed to be redesigned to accommodate external customers. 
Key objectives included:
- For customers: reduce phone and email orders and enquiries by adapting the portal to customer needs
- For admin users: reducing inefficiencies for Holcim employees with admin roles.

Customers used the portal to channel their commercial relationship with Holcim, from ordering materials to tracking deliveries or checking invoices.

Holcim employees used the portal to manage customer info, review deliveries and upload relevant information for customers, among other admin tasks.

# Research and alignment
---
## Stakeholder interviews

Interviews with stakeholders provided invaluable insights into the company's operations and the existing portal infrastructure. This enabled us to gather requirements, identify pain points, and align our design approach with stakeholder expectations.

## Definition workshops

At the beginning of each sprint, I would have a workshop with the stakeholder responsible for the feature we were about to start working on.

At this meeting we discussed:
- Requirements and assumptions
- Backend structure and constraints
- Problems users were facing
- Other ideas we might have had

This approach ensured that our design decisions were well informed and aligned with the project goals.
