- Delivered a responsive version of the portal, addressing a previously unmet need
- Introduced new features including a dashboard and notification system

<br>

## Context
---
### About Holcim

Holcim is a leading supplier of cement, aggregates and other materials. With a presence in 70 countries and more than 63,000 employees worldwide, Holcim is committed to driving progress for people and the planet through innovative and sustainable building solutions.

### Problem to solve

Originally developed as an internal tool, Holcimâ€™s Customer Portal needed to be redesigned to accommodate external customers. 
Key objectives included:
- Adapting the portal to meet customer needs
- Reducing inefficiencies for Holcim employees with admin roles.

Customers used the portal to channel their commercial relationship with Holcim, from ordering materials to tracking deliveries or checking invoices.

Holcim employees used the portal to manage customer info, review deliveries and upload relevant information for customers, among other admin tasks.

## My role
---
I was responsible for UX in a team consisting of a visual designer, a front-end designer, a project manager and myself. I conducted the research, defined requirements and designed wireframes for the project. 

<br>

## Research and alignment
---
### Stakeholder interviews

Interviews with stakeholders provided invaluable insights into the company's operations and the existing portal infrastructure. This enabled us to gather requirements, identify pain points, and align our design approach with stakeholder expectations.

### Definition meetings

At the beginning of each sprint I had a workshop with the stakeholder responsible for the section or process we had to work on.

- On that meeting we discussed:
- Requirements and assumptions
- Backend structure and limitations
- Problems users were facing 
- Other Ideas we may had

This approach ensured that our design decisions were well-informed and aligned with project goals.
