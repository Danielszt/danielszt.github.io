## Problem to solve

Originally developed as an internal tool, Holcim’s Customer Portal was opened to customers without proper adaptation, resulting in poor adoption and many UX problems. Holcim hired us to fix this. 

The customer portal has 2 types of users:
- Customers:  use the portal to manage their commercial relationship with Holcim, like ordering materials, tracking deliveries or  checking invoices.
- Admins: use the portal to manage customer information, upload documents for customers and provide support.

Key objectives included:
- Reducing phone/email orders and inquiries from customers.
- Increase portal adoption by customers
- Reducing inefficiencies for Holcim employees with admin roles.
- Detecting and fixing as many usability problems as possible.

# Discovery
---
## Stakeholder interviews

Interviews with stakeholders provided invaluable insights into the company's operations and the existing portal infrastructure. This enabled us to gather requirements, identify pain points, and align our design approach with stakeholder expectations. 

Unfortunately, we couldn't talk directly to customers, so we interviewed several people from customer support and other customer-facing roles to gain insights into customer needs, pain points, and preferences.

Main discovery insights:
- Current order process is too complex and time-consuming for customers.
- Customers find it difficult to track their orders, leading to uncertainty and delays.
- Customers find it challenging to reorder previous purchases quickly.
- We could simplify navigation by grouping similar features under a common section.
- Customers can’t use the portal on mobile, limiting their ability to manage orders on the go.
- The portal lacks a notification system, causing customers to miss important updates.
- Customers who place bulk orders find the current system inadequate for handling their needs efficiently.
- Customers face difficulties managing their account settings, such as updating contact information or payment methods.
- There are frequent bottlenecks in customer support due to repetitive queries that could be addressed by self-service options.

# Definition

## Information architecture

To set the basis for the redesign and  agree on scope I defined the Information architecture. 

I followed this process: 
1. Mapped the previous architecture
2. Explored all sections
3. Got familiar with the details
4. Merged conceptually similar features
5. Presented it to stakeholders to get their input and iterate 

We should have tested it with users, but we didn’t. I would have done an open card sorting to uncover user mental models and a tree testing to validate the proposal.

## Aligment workshops

At the beginning of each sprint, I would have a workshop with the stakeholder responsible for the feature we were about to start working on.

At this meeting we discussed:
- Requirements and assumptions
- Backend structure and constraints
- Problems users were facing
- Other ideas we might have had

The output of the meeting was a shared PRD (Product Requirements Document) This approach ensured that our design decisions were well informed and aligned with the project goals.
