## About Fever
------
[Fever](https://feverup.com/) is an app that helps people to find things to do and places to go in their cities. It offers plans of all types, from nightlife, restaurants and concerts to cultural events or sports activities.

Rakuten, Atresmedia and Accel are some of its main[investors](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/data-driven-events-discovery-and-planning-startup-fever-raises-35-million-led-by-rakuten/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALDc4r5RQdfQVYfvinZ9bRboLwWg_ZwbNKTnISSmYLqY8nccxegEMMZnaWwmPbdvlQT9TfYxTxHTmBuAjjR3DLBswgL6K0wwa-wmHiUMFefgPwMD6yHzJ_NGMv1EvYqwTBCF1V9mrD0JULIik089aSyz3xBT1W5nT1tD4mokIl_6).

## Content writing
------
As part of the content team, I wrote over 1000 Fever events for Spain and some for London and New York. All of them in HTML and using Fever's internal CMS.

I always tried to follow 3 principles:
- The event's information must be clear and concise.
- The text must be scannable so it's not necessary to read everything to understand what's important.
- Each event should be unique and attractive.

    >
</a>

## Style guide
------

Our team was composed of 9 people who wrote in 5 languages for many cities around the world. Despite the large volume of content generated everyday, there was no documentation that unified them or addressed topics such as voice, tone, hierarchy, vocabulary or HTML structure.

To try to solve this, I proposed to take charge of creating a style guide. With the help of the rest of the team, we will soon launch version 1.0 in Confluence.

## Product y UX writing
------

After a few months in Fever I started to work more closely with the product team. I used this opportunity to integrate the definition of the content into the design process and to evangelize about the importance of UX writing.

Soon I assumed the role of UX writer and started working with the team on the new features of the app. In addition, I carried out a review of the app's microcopies that resulted in the modification of more than 30 text strings.
