## 🧭 Context
---
Getnet is **[Santander bank's](https://www.santander.com/)** payment solutions platform for merchants around the world.

After its launch in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, it was time to open Getnet to the European market. In this context, **Sandanter bank asked the cocktail to design the Getnet website for Europe.**

The website had to meet **2 objectives**:

- Effectively communicate Getnet's value proposition and products.
- Capture new leads.

<br>
## ☝🏻 My role 
---
I was the principal **UX designer**. My main responsibilities were:

- Gathering business and product requirements.
- Communicate design ideas and solutions to stakeholders.
- Defining the information architecture and navigation model.
- Designing low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
- Documenting the designs for the developer handoff.

## 🔎 Research
---
### Immersion sessions
At the beginning of the project, we met with several Getnet teams and stakeholders. This helped us understand their business, their product offering, and the problems they intended to solve.

### Competitor analysis

I analyzed how other players in the market structured their sites and their value proposition, identifying key messages and content priority. The results helped us to better understand the payments industry and make better information architecture decisions.

### Architecture
Now that I had managed to understand Getnet's complex ecosystem, It was time to define the information architecture of the web. This was the result:

### Navigation
Once the  the information architecture was validated with stakeholders, I designed a navigation model that would allow users to:

- Navigate comfortably through the different sections.
- Explore Getnet's products from different perspectives (by feature, by industry...)

### Pages and modules
We adopted a content-first + modular design approach to design all pages. This means that content determines the structure of each page and we design content blocks that can be used on any page.
