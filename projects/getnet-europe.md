## 🧭 Context
---
Getnet is **[Santander bank's](https://www.santander.com/)** payment solutions platform for merchants around the world.

After its launch in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, it was time to open Getnet to the European market. In this context, **Sandanter bank asked the cocktail to design the Getnet website for Europe.**

The website had to meet **2 objectives**:

- Effectively communicate Getnet's value proposition and products.
- Capture new leads.

<br>
## ☝🏻 My role 
---
I was the principal **UX designer**. My main responsibilities were:

- Gathering business and product requirements.
- Communicate design ideas and solutions to stakeholders.
- Defining the information architecture and navigation model.
- Designing low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
- Documenting the designs for the developer handoff.

<br>
## 🔎 Research
---
### Immersion sessions
At the beginning of the project, we met with several Getnet teams and stakeholders. This helped us understand their business, their product offering, and the problems they intended to solve.

### Competitor analysis

I analyzed how other players in the market structured their sites and their value proposition, identifying key messages and content priority. The results helped us to better understand the payments industry and make better information architecture decisions.
