## 🧭 Context

Getnet is **[Santander bank's](https://www.santander.com/)** payment solutions platform for merchants around the world.

After its launch in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, it was time to open Getnet to the European market. In this context, **Sandanter bank asked the cocktail to design the Getnet website for Europe.**

The website had to meet **2 objectives**:

- Effectively communicate Getnet's value proposition and products.
- Capture new leads.

## ☝🏻 My role 

I was the principal **UX designer**. My main responsibilities were:

- Gathering business and product requirements.
- Communicate design ideas and solutions to stakeholders.
- Defining the information architecture and navigation model.
- Designing low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
- Documenting the designs for the developer handoff.
