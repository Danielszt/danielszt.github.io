# Context
---
### About Meli√°

Meli√° is the third largest hotel chain in Europe, with 350+ hotels in 35 countries. I worked with them on several projects over the course of about a year. 
<br>
<br>

### The problem

Meli√° restaurants managed table reservations through a variety of methods, mostly phone calls and third parties. The lack of an unified reservation system caused inconsistent customer experience and operational inefficiencies.
<br>
<br>

### Role and team

The team consisted of a UX designer (myself), a visual designer, a front-end developer and a product manager. We worked closely with Melia's product manager and engineers.
<br>
<br>

### Design process <br>


1. **Discovery**:	understand the problem, user needs and business goals
2. **Definition**: agree on what criteria the solution should meet
3. **Prototype**:	explore and communicate design ideas
4. **Test**: identify gaps in the solution and reduce risk
5. **Final design**:	develop a polished design ready for implementation

<br>

# Discovery
---
### Stakeholder interviews

First I outlined our learning objectives and prepared the interview script. Then I met with Melia's product manager, channel manager and engineer responsible for the restaurant reservation system

This helped me to gather initial requirements and understand business goals.
<br>

#### Business goals <br>
- Increase efficiency:	streamline the reservation process to reduce staff worload and improve inventary management
- Reduce dependency on third parties:	minimise reliance on third-party reservation systems and reduce associated costs
- Improve brand experience:	ensure consistent quality and brand experience across all touchpoints, reinforcing brand reliability

<br>

### Backoffice analysis
<br>

<br>

I explored the backoffice and discussed my questions with the Meli√° team. This helped me to ensure data consistency and identify technical constraints.
<br>

**Technical constraints**:

- **Can‚Äôt modify reservations**: the system couldn't handle reservation changes, just delete them and create new ones.
- **Can‚Äôt show availability at calendar level**: the booking engine couldn‚Äôt show availability at calendar level due to performance reasons.
- **Time slots must be service-based**: time slots had to be split by service (breakfast, lunch...) and be presented at 15 minute intervals.
-  **Not all reservations are auto-confirmed**: restaurants could disable automatic confirmation for large groups or people.

<br>

## Definition
---
### Requirements document

With all the info I had from the discovery, I wroted a productd requirements document (PRD) stating:

- Problem to solve
- Goals
- KPIs
- Limit and constrains
- Requirements

I reviewed it with Melia‚Äôs team to make sure we were on the same page.

<br>

### User flow

Using the PRD as a foundation, I created a user flow and reviewed it with the team and stakeholders.

This allowed us to:

- Map all use cases
- Connect user flow with backend system
- Account for user communications

## Prototype
---
### Low-fi exploration

I started exploring with very low fidelity.

This always help me visualise many ideas quickly and weigh the pros and cons.

<br>

### Wireframe prototype

After some iterations and good feedback, I ended up with a solid proposal. I prototyped each use case so everyone could ‚Äúfeel‚Äù and test the experience.

## Test
---
### Guerrilla testing

User testing wasn't in the budget or project plan, so instead I did some guerrilla testing.

No problems were reported, which gave me mixed feelings.

<br>

## Final design
